%p
  Since 2010, Practicing Ruby has produced a total of
  = "#{@counts[:published]} articles, "
  all of which were funded by our generous subscribers.
  We are gradually transitioning to an open-access model
  for our content, and below you will find the
  = "#{@counts[:public]} articles that have been released into "
  our public archives. 

%p 
  If you enjoy these articles, please consider
  = link_to "becoming a Practicing Ruby subscriber.", subscriptions_path
  By doing so, you'll get immediate access to the 
  = "#{@counts[:members]} articles that we published between"
  = "#{@member_old_date} and #{@member_recent_date}"
  which have not been released to the public yet. You'll
  also be supporting our future work, as we continue on
  our mission to build a great learning resource
  for all Ruby programmers.
